My statistics course project aimed to develop a user-friendly platform catering to advanced 
Business Analysts who lacked programming knowledge. The primary objective was to enable 
these analysts to conduct comprehensive consultations, analyses, and modeling of stock time series data. The platform incorporated both Descriptive and Predictive analytics to facilitate specific stock searches, query particular time ranges, and perform associated analyses, such as statistical descriptions of prices and/or volume (mean, median, range, etc.). Additionally, the platform offered various technical indicators, visualizations of raw data and transformations (e.g., moving averages), and basic modeling capabilities, like regression. By leveraging these features, users could predict future prices of different companies' stocks, assisting them in making informed trading decisions within a specified period.
